# Tech-Blog

## Description

This project was created to further my knowledge of the MVC paradigm in the form of a blog. It allows the user to login and write posts related to the tech world. Users may also add comments to each post and delete posts that they have created. I learned that for each controller there has to be some connection to the different views pages. Unfortunately I did not quite complete this assignment as there are a few errors that need to be fixed in regards to authorizaiton and the comments section. I will definitely come back to finish this as my knowledge grows.
